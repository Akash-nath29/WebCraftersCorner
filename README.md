# WebCraftersCorner

Welcome to the WebCraftersCorner repository by DevDotCom! This repository is designed to help you enhance your web development skills through a structured set of practice questions. Whether you're a beginner looking to build a strong foundation or an experienced developer aiming to sharpen your web development skills, this repository is for you.

## Introduction

Web development is a dynamic field with a diverse set of technologies and concepts. To become proficient in web development, it's essential to practice and apply your knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The Web Development Practice Questions repository offers a comprehensive set of practice questions divided into weeks, with each week containing daily exercises. This structured approach allows you to progress gradually and steadily improve your web development skills.

## How to Use

You can use these practice questions to:

- Reinforce your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.
- Explore more advanced web development concepts and problem-solving.
- Develop practical coding skills through real-world examples.

Simply follow the weekly structure, starting with Week 1, and work through the questions day by day. Each question comes with a suggested list of concepts you should be familiar with to tackle the task successfully.

If you're just getting started with web development, begin with Week 1 and gradually progress through the weeks.
