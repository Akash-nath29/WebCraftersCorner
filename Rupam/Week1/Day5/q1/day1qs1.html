    <p>The 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup is the 13th edition of the Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The tournament is being hosted by India. It started on 5 October and is scheduled to conclude on 19 November 2023.Ten national teams are participating. All had to qualify for the tournament through the 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification process. India qualified as hosts; Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa qualified via the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, with the Netherlands and Sri Lanka securing the final two places via the qualifier tournament in Zimbabwe during June and July 2023. The West Indies missed out on qualification for the first time in their history. All teams were asked to finalise their 15-player squads prior to 28 September, with any replacements after this date requiring approval from the ICC. A selection panel chose 16 officials to umpire and referee at the matches. The host broadcaster is Star Sports, with various affiliates offering coverage around the world.

        It is the first men's Cricket World Cup which India is hosting solely. The tournament is taking place in ten different stadiums, in ten cities across the country.
